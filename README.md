**Make the Logo Bigger!**

*Are your clients self-important pricks who believe the size of their logo must reflect the enormity of their lame awesomeness?*

*Tired of fulfilling requests to make the logo bigger?*

If "yes" is the answer to either of these questions, this script is for you.

Instructions
============

1. Load it up (including jQuery).
1. Adjust the brandBluster factor to match your clientâ€™s misguided sense of what is important. [default = 1.8]
1. Bask in the shadow or your newly, bulbous logo.
